==== transportSummaryConsignmentIdUsingGET
    
`GET /api/${SERVICE_ID}/${VERSION}/consignments/transportSummaries/consignmentId/{consignmentId}`

Get the transport summary for a consignment given a consignment ID

===== Description 

Provide the consignment ID for a consignment.  Transport Plan Analysis: This endpoint will return all of the transport plans for the consignment, ordered from most recent to oldest. Each transport plan will include a list of planned events, ordered by the event occurrence time. Together these events indicate the series of locations that each transport equipment, that is associated with the given consignnment, will move on its journey.  Planned events provide the planned route of a transport equipment.  Note that the only events returned by this endpoint are the set of events known as “transport” planned events. This does NOT include consignment, transport equipment, generic, or document events. For a complete list of transport events, see the Transport Events category in the Event Publish Swagger documentation. To get all events for a consignment use the …/events/consignmentId/{consignmentId} endpoint.  Commodity and originator information visibility is restricted to orgs that were onboarded with certain types. If your org does not have one of these correct types, then you may not have visibility to the following fields in each event: Commodity information: - harmonizedCodes - bookingData.commodities.commodityDescription - bookingData.commodities.commodityHarmonizedCode  Originator information: - originatorName - originatorId - senderOrgId  In addition, The originator information on a Party Add/Update/Remove event will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the event or one of the parties being added. The originator information and 'destinationOrgName' field on a Document event whose 'action' field is 'issued', 'transferred', or 'surrendered' will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the event or the org that the document is being transferred to.

[.EventQueries]
=== EventQueries


[.queryUnassociatedEventsUsingGET]
==== queryUnassociatedEventsUsingGET
    
`GET /api/${SERVICE_ID}/${VERSION}/unassociatedEvents`

Fetch unassociated events

===== Description 

Queries for all unassociated events visible to the user. This includes \"orphaned\" events which are events that are not associated with a trade instrument yet. This also includes \"homeless\" events which are events that will never be associated with a trade instrument for various reasons. For example, if the event's identifiers match multiple trade instruments then the event might be in the homeless category.  We return up to a maximum of 1000 of each unassociated event type in one query. Paging is used to retrieve events beyond this number. Provide the \"newFrom\" value from the response body as the \"from\" parameter to retrieve the next page of results. If \"from\" is given, all other parameters are ignored, except for \"size\".  The fields listed below all refer to locations. More than one location field can be queried on at a time, but if multiple location fields are used, then only the events that match ALL specified location fields will be returned. - unlocode - address - smdgTerminal - geoCoord - splc - gln

[.currentProgressConsignmentIdUsingGET]
==== currentProgressConsignmentIdUsingGET
    
`GET /api/${SERVICE_ID}/${VERSION}/transportEquipment/currentProgress/consignmentId/{consignmentId}`

Get the current progress for one or more pieces of transport equipment 

===== Description 

Provide the consignmentId of a Consignment. Returns the current progress of all transport equipment associated with that consignment.   Transport events are divided into three categories: planned, estimated and actual. Planned events provide the planned route of a transport equipment. Estimated events provide the estimated time things will occur to the transport equipment. Actual events indicate things that occurred to the transport equipment.  Current Progress Analysis:  The current progress will include a list of current progress events, ordered by the sequence in which they occur. Together these events indicate the series of locations that each transport equipment will move, or has moved, on its journey and everything that happened to it along the way.  Each current progress event is made up of a list of actual events, a list of estimated events and the associated planned event.  Note that the only events returned by this endpoint are the set of events known as “transport” events. This does NOT include consignment, transport equipment, generic, or document events. For a complete list of transport events, see the Transport Events category in the Event Publish Swagger documentation. To get all events for a consignment or transport equipment, use the …/events/... endpoint.  Commodity and originator information visibility is restricted to orgs that were onboarded with certain types. If your org does not have one of these correct types, then you may not have visibility to the following fields in each event: Commodity information: - harmonizedCodes - bookingData.commodities.commodityDescription - bookingData.commodities.commodityHarmonizedCode  Originator information: - originatorName - originatorId - senderOrgId  In addition, The originator information on a Party Add/Update/Remove event will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the event or one of the parties being added. The originator information and 'destinationOrgName' field on a Document event whose 'action' field is 'issued', 'transferred', or 'surrendered' will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the event or the org that the document is being transferred to.

Each current progress event is made up of a list of actual events, a list of estimated events and the associated planned event.  Note that the only events returned by this endpoint are the set of events known as “transport” events. This does NOT include consignment, transport equipment, generic, or document events. For a complete list of transport events, see the Transport Events category in the Event Publish Swagger documentation. To get all events for a consignment or transport equipment, use the …/events/... endpoint.  Commodity and originator information visibility is restricted to orgs that were onboarded with certain types. If your org does not have one of these correct types, then you may not have visibility to the following fields in each event: Commodity information: - harmonizedCodes - bookingData.commodities.commodityDescription - bookingData.commodities.commodityHarmonizedCode  Originator information: - originatorName - originatorId - senderOrgId  In addition, The originator information on a Party Add/Update/Remove event will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the event or one of the parties being added. The originator information and 'destinationOrgName' field on a Document event whose 'action' field is 'issued', 'transferred', or 'surrendered' will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the event or the org that the document is being transferred to.

`GET /api/${SERVICE_ID}/${VERSION}/transportEquipment/events/consignmentId/{consignmentId}`

Query TE events by consignment ID

===== Description 

Query for events belonging to all Transport Equipments associated with the Consignment with the given ID. The event filter parameter can be used to control how much processing is done to the resulting list.   * latest - Only the most recent versions of an event will be returned. The transportPlanIssuanceTime8601 will be used to determine the most recent Planned events. All Actual events will be returned, no filtering is done. For Estimated events, the location, the eventSubmissionTime, the originatorId, and the fullStatus fields will be used. For non transport events, the eventSubmissionTime will be used.   * all - No filtering is done. All events are returned.   If the eventFilter is not specified, the default is \"all\".  You may optionally specify a transportEquipmentId to return only results for the transport equipment with that ID.   The list of events are sorted on occurrence time if present, otherwise the submission time.  Commodity and originator information visibility is restricted to orgs that were onboarded with certain types. If your org does not have one of these correct types, then you may not have visibility to the following fields in each event: Commodity information: - harmonizedCodes - bookingData.commodities.commodityDescription - bookingData.commodities.commodityHarmonizedCode  Originator information: - originatorName - originatorId - senderOrgId  In addition, The originator information on a Party Add/Update/Remove event will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the event or one of the parties being added. The originator information and 'destinationOrgName' field on a Document event whose 'action' field is 'issued', 'transferred', or 'surrendered' will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the event or the org that the document is being transferred to.
