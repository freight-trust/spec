  The Transport Document ID number is an identifier that links to a shipment,
  i.e. a Bill of Lading or a Sea Waybill. A bill of lading is the document of
  title to the goods issued to the customer which confirms the carrier's receipt
  of the cargo from the customer, acknowledging goods being shipped and
  specifying the terms of delivery.

  The Sea Waybill is a simpler document, the main difference being that it is
  non-negotiable.
