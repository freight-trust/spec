  summary: >-
    Get the current progress for one or more pieces of transport equipment that
    were split from the consignment with the given consignment ID
  description: >
    Provide the consignmentId for a consignment. Returns the current progress
    for all of the transport equipment split from the consignment that are not
    yet associated with another consignment. 

    Current Progress Analysis: 

    The current progress will include a list of current progress events, ordered
    by the sequence in which they occur. Together these events indicate the
    series of locations that each transport equipment will move, or has moved,
    on its journey and everything that happened to it along the way. 

    Each current progress event is made up of a list of actual events, a list of
    estimated events and the associated planned event.


    Note that the only events returned by this endpoint are the set of events
    known as “transport” events. This does NOT include consignment, transport
    equipment, generic, or document events. For a complete list of transport
    events, see the Transport Events category in the Event Publish Swagger
    documentation. To get all events for a consignment or transport equipment,
    use the …/events/... endpoint.


    Commodity and originator information visibility is restricted to orgs that
    were onboarded with certain types. If your org does not have one of these
    correct types, then you may not have visibility to the following fields in
    each event:

    Commodity information:

    - harmonizedCodes

    - bookingData.commodities.commodityDescription

    - bookingData.commodities.commodityHarmonizedCode


    Originator information:

    - originatorName

    - originatorId

    - senderOrgId


    In addition, The originator information on a Party Add/Update/Remove event
    will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the event or one of the
    parties being added. The originator information and 'destinationOrgName'
    field on a Document event whose 'action' field is 'issued', 'transferred',
    or 'surrendered' will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the
    event or the org that the document is being transferred to.
