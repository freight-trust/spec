  summary: "Get the current progress for a transport equipment "
  description: >
    Provide the transport equipment ID of a transport equipment. Returns the
    current progress of the transport equipment with that ID. 

    Transport events are divided into three categories: planned, estimated and
    actual. Planned events provide the planned route of a transport equipment.
    Estimated events provide the estimated time things will occur to the
    transport equipment. Actual events indicate things that occurred to the
    transport equipment.


    Current Progress Analysis: 

    The current progress will include a list of current progress events, ordered
    by the sequence in which they occur. Together these events indicate the
    series of locations that each transport equipment will move, or has moved,
    on its journey and everything that happened to it along the way. 

    Each current progress event is made up of a list of actual events, a list of
    estimated events and the associated planned event.


    Note that the only events returned by this endpoint are the set of events
    known as “transport” events. This does NOT include consignment, transport
    equipment, generic, or document events. For a complete list of transport
    events, see the Transport Events category in the Event Publish Swagger
    documentation. To get all events for a consignment or transport equipment,
    use the …/events/... endpoint.


    Commodity and originator information visibility is restricted to orgs that

    - bookingData.commodities.commodityDescription

    - bookingData.commodities.commodityHarmonizedCode

    parties being added. The originator information and 'destinationOrgName'
    field on a Document event whose 'action' field is 'issued', 'transferred',
    or 'surrendered' will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the
    event or the org that the document is being transferred to.
