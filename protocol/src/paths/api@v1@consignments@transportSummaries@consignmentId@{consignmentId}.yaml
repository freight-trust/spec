  summary: Get the transport summary for a consignment given a consignment ID
  description: >
    Provide the consignment ID for a consignment. 

    Transport Plan Analysis: This endpoint will return all of the transport
    plans for the consignment, ordered from most recent to oldest. Each
    transport plan will include a list of planned events, ordered by the event
    occurrence time. Together these events indicate the series of locations that
    each transport equipment, that is associated with the given consignnment,
    will move on its journey.


    Planned events provide the planned route of a transport equipment.


    Note that the only events returned by this endpoint are the set of events
    known as “transport” planned events. This does NOT include consignment,
    transport equipment, generic, or document events. For a complete list of
    transport events, see the Transport Events category in the Event Publish
    Swagger documentation. To get all events for a consignment use the
    …/events/consignmentId/{consignmentId} endpoint.


    Commodity and originator information visibility is restricted to orgs that
    were onboarded with certain types. If your org does not have one of these
    correct types, then you may not have visibility to the following fields in
    each event:

    - bookingData.commodities.commodityDescription

    - bookingData.commodities.commodityHarmonizedCode

    In addition, The originator information on a Party Add/Update/Remove event

    parties being added. The originator information and 'destinationOrgName'
    field on a Document event whose 'action' field is 'issued', 'transferred',
    or 'surrendered' will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the
    event or the org that the document is being transferred to.
