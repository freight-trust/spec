  summary: "Get the transport summary for one or more pieces of transport equipment "
  description: >
    Provide the consignmentId of a Consignment. Returns the transport summary of
    all transport equipment associated with that consignment. 

    Transport Plan Analysis: This endpoint will construct an up-to-date
    transport summary for each transport equipment returned by the query. This
    transport summary will include a list of transport plan events, ordered by
    the sequence in which they occur. Together these events indicate the series
    of locations that each transport equipment will move, or has moved, on its
    journey and everything that happened to it along the way.


    Events are divided into three categories: planned, estimated and actual.
    Planned events provide the planned route of a transport equipment. Estimated
    events provide the estimated time things will occur to the transport
    equipment. Actual events indicate things that occurred to the transport
    equipment.


    The event filter parameter can be used to control the processing done in the
    transport plan analysis.


    * latest -  The transportPlanIssuanceTime8601 will be used to determine the
    most recent transport plan. All Actual events will be returned, no filtering
    is done. For Estimated events, the location, the eventSubmissionTime, the
    originatorId, and the fullStatus fields will be used to determine the most
    recent version of the event. Estimated events will be replaced by the
    corresponding Actual events. The resulting list will contain the Planned
    event (if there is one) followed by the Actual or Estimated (if not Actual).


    * all - All the transport plans sent to this trade object will be returned,
    from most recent to oldest. Each transport plan will have a version, the
    transport plan issuance date, and the name of the organization that sent the
    plan, along with the list of Planned events.


    Note that the only events returned by this endpoint are the set of events
    known as “transport”events. This does NOT include consignment, transport
    equipment, generic, or document events. For a complete list of transport
    events, see the Transport Events category in the Event Publish Swagger
    documentation. To get all events for a consignment or transport equipment,
    use the …/events/... endpoint.


    Commodity and originator information visibility is restricted to orgs that
    were onboarded with certain types. If your org does not have one of these
    correct types, then you may not have visibility to the following fields in
    each event:

    Commodity information:

    - harmonizedCodes

    - bookingData.commodities.commodityDescription

    - bookingData.commodities.commodityHarmonizedCode


    Originator information:

    - originatorName

    - originatorId

    - senderOrgId


    In addition, The originator information on a Party Add/Update/Remove event
    will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the event or one of the
    parties being added. The originator information and 'destinationOrgName'
    field on a Document event whose 'action' field is 'issued', 'transferred',
    or 'surrendered' will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the
    event or the org that the document is being transferred to.
