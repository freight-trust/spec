      name: transportDocumentID
      description: >-
        The Transport Document ID number is an identifier that links to a
        shipment, i.e. a Bill of Lading or a Sea Waybill. A bill of lading is
        the document of title to the goods issued to the customer which confirms
        the carrier's receipt of the cargo from the customer, acknowledging
        goods being shipped and specifying the terms of delivery. The Sea
        Waybill is a simpler document, the main difference being that it is
        non-negotiable.
