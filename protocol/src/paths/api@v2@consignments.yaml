  summary: Query all consignments
  description: >
    Queries for all consignments visible to the user, filtered using the
    criteria below.


    We return up to a maximum of 1000 consignments in one query. Paging is used
    to retrieve consignments beyond this number. Provide the "newFrom" value
    from the response body as the "from" parameter to retrieve the next page of
    results. If "from" is given, all other parameters are ignored, except for
    "size".


    For the fields listed below, wildcard matching is supported. A '*' can be
    used in place of one or more characters, and a '?' can replace a single
    character.

    - exportCountry

    - importCountry

    - entryPort

    - exitPort

    - consignmentId

    - references

    - transportEquipmentId

    - transportEquipmentReferences

    - harmonizedCode

    - billOfLadingNumber

    - carrierBookingNumber

    - originLocation

    - destinationLocation

    - terminal


    Commodity information visibility is restricted to orgs that were onboarded
    with certain types. If your org does not have one of the correct types, then
    the following fields will be removed from all consignment response objects,
    and you will not be allowed to search on these fields:

    - harmonizedCode

    - commodityHarmonizedCode (in the commodities array in bookingData)

    - commodityDescription (in the commodities array in bookingData)
