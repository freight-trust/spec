  summary: Query all shipments
  description: >+
    Queries for all shipments visible to the user, filtered using the criteria
    below.


    We return up to a maximum of 1000 shipments in one query. Paging is used to
    retrieve shipments beyond this number. Provide the "newFrom" value from the
    response body as the "from" parameter to retrieve the next page of results.
    If "from" is given, all other parameters are ignored, except for "size".


    Note: A leading wildcard will not be added to shipment queries.
