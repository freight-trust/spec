    - Transport Equipment Queries
  summary: Query TE events by TE ID
  description: >
    Query for events for the Transport Equipment with the given ID. The event
    filter parameter can be used to control how much processing is done to the
    resulting list.



    * latest - Only the most recent versions of an event will be returned. The
    transportPlanIssuanceTime8601 will be used to determine the most recent
    Planned events. All Actual events will be returned, no filtering is done.
    For Estimated events, the location, the eventSubmissionTime, the
    originatorId, and the fullStatus fields will be used. For non transport
    events, the eventSubmissionTime will be used.



    * all - No filtering is done. All events are returned.



    If the eventFilter is not specified, the default is "all".  You may
    optionally specify a transportEquipmentId to return only results for the
    transport equipment with that ID.



    The list of events are sorted on occurrence time if present, otherwise the
    submission time.


    Commodity and originator information visibility is restricted to orgs that
    were onboarded with certain types. If your org does not have one of these
    correct types, then you may not have visibility to the following fields in
    each event:

    Commodity information:

    - harmonizedCodes

    - bookingData.commodities.commodityDescription

    - bookingData.commodities.commodityHarmonizedCode


    Originator information:

    - originatorName

    - originatorId

    - senderOrgId


    In addition, The originator information on a Party Add/Update/Remove event
    will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the event or one of the
    parties being added. The originator information and 'destinationOrgName'
    field on a Document event whose 'action' field is 'issued', 'transferred',
    or 'surrendered' will be hidden if you are not the org who submitted the
    event or the org that the document is being transferred to.
